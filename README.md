# Branching Strategies 
 Project 2 - as Project 2 deals with the IoT Device Management System that uses Representational State Transfer (REST) model , the branching strategy that can be used is Github Flow because it focuses on Agile principles and it is a fast and streamlined branching strategy.
 Project 3 - as we will be working with an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will need to be enhanced and improved for this project , we will need to understand architectural patterns as well as pay attention to implementing coding principles and design patterns as our branching strategy.
 Project 4 - as Project 4 will all be about testing , the branching strategy that can be used is Git Flow since it has two main branches which is the master branch and a develop branch but in this project there will be the testers and the front-end.

# The use of .gitignore file 
I will use the .gitignore file in my git repository for each project to tell the git not to track certain files and folders that I do not want being uploaded to my main repository.
# The storage of credentials and sensitive information
I will be storing all the credentials and sensitive information for my repositories and projects on my GitHub account and I have already created a folder on my laptop to store all the information there.

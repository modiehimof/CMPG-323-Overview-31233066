# Branching Strategies 
 Project 2 - as Project 2 deals with the IoT Device Management System that uses Representational State Transfer (REST) model , the branching strategy that can be used is Github Flow because it focuses on Agile principles and it is a fast and streamlined branching strategy.
 Project 3 - as we will be working with an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will need to be enhanced and improved for this project , we will need to understand architectural patterns as well as pay attention to implementing coding principles and design patterns as our branching strategy.
 Project 4 - as Project 4 will all be about testing , the branching strategy that can be used is Git Flow since it has two main branches which is the master branch and a develop branch but in this project there will be the testers and the front-end.
